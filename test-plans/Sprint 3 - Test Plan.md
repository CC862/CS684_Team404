# Test Plan for Team 404 Personal News Feed Application

## Team Members: Ahsan Hasnath, Cristofer Carcamo, Joshua Steinerman, Zal Patel, Akshay Patel*
## Class: CS-684: Quality Assurance*

### Introduction
The purpose of this test plan for Project 404 has been designed to ensure that the personal news feed application is fully functional, meets user requirements, and operates as expected. The project involves retrieving the most recent and fresh headlines from "https://newsapi.org/," allowing users to sign up and log in to their accounts, select categories of interest, and search for specific subjects.

### Scope:
This test plan covers the testing of the personal news feed project sprint by sprint. Sprint 1 included creating sign-up and sign-in pages with a generic home page, developing the API, and manual testing. Sprint 2 includes adding a home page with general headlines and a settings page, along with unit testing. Sprint 3 involves developing a custom home page, implementing pagination, and integrating testing. Sprint 4 includes the implementation of the searching feature and system testing.

Throughout the sprints team, 404 will cover Manual, functional, API, Unit, integration, and system testing The goal is to identify any defects, issues, or inconsistencies in the project and ensure that it meets the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders.
The testing will be conducted in a test environment that closely mimics the production environment to ensure accurate results. The testing team will consist of qualified testers with relevant expertise and experience. The test plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it is aligned with the project's progress and objectives.
This test plan covers four sprints:
Sprint 1 (Feb 20 - Mar 6): Sign-up and login pages with a generic home page.
Sprint 2 (Mar 6 - Mar 27): Home page with general headlines and a settings page.
Sprint 3 (Mar 27 - Apr 10): Custom home page and pagination.
Sprint 4 (Apr 10 - Apr 24): Searching.
